Implement the following features in the Order Management module:

1. Template Option

Add a “Download Template” button to export a blank CSV with these exact headers:

Order Number, Date, Customer, Item Name, Live Weight, KG/PCG Price, PCS, Discount %, Discount TK, PAID BILL, Payment Method, Comment


The Customer field can be empty, no errors should be raised.

2. Import Option

Add an “Import CSV” button to upload CSV files.

After uploading:

Show a Preview Page with parsed data.

If there are errors or missing fields → display them in an Error Log Table.

Allow the user to edit/fix errors inline before submitting.

Include a Submit button to finalize import.

3. Progress Bar for Large Imports

Since huge data will be imported, implement a progress bar with % completion so users can monitor progress.

Ensure import does not freeze.

4. Export Option

Add an “Export Data” button to download all orders in CSV format, keeping the same template headers.

5. Item Handling per Order

Each order can have multiple items under the same Order Number.

When viewing an order:

Show all items grouped together.

Display the total calculated bill for that order.

6. Calculation Rules

If Live Weight is filled (grams):

Convert grams → kilograms.

Formula:

(Live Weight ÷ 1000) × KG/PCG Price


Example:

Live Weight = 1150 g

KG/PCG Price = 400 (per KG)

Calculation = (1150 ÷ 1000) × 400 = 1.15 × 400 = 460 TK

If Live Weight is empty (per PCS item):

Formula:

PCS × KG/PCG Price


Example:

PCS = 3

KG/PCG Price = 20 (per piece)

Calculation = 3 × 20 = 60 TK

Apply Discounts:

If Discount % exists → reduce that percentage.

If Discount TK exists → subtract that fixed amount.

Formula:

Final Bill = (Calculated Total – Discount TK) – (Calculated Total × (Discount % ÷ 100))

7. Error Handling Page

After import, open a new page showing:

Errors highlighted row-wise (invalid/missing values).

Option to edit and fix directly in the table.

Re-submit button after corrections.

8. Final Data Flow

Once confirmed, data is saved into the Order Management system.

PAID BILL column auto-calculates from Live Weight/PCS × KG/PCG Price minus discounts.

Totals are synced per order so the full bill is always correct.
